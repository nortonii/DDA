## Introduction

DDA (Decoupled Data Augmentation) is a novel method designed for Generalized Out-of-Distribution (GOSR) tasks. Unlike previous methods, DDA breaks through the assumption that high-frequency information required for OOD tasks is strictly less than that required for ID tasks. This breakthrough allows DDA to achieve superior performance in identifying and handling out-of-distribution data.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository. The installation steps and dependencies will be provided once the code is uploaded.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DDA-GOSR.git
cd DDA-GOSR
```

## Usage

Usage instructions will be available once the code is uploaded.

## Datasets

Links to datasets and instructions for their use will be provided in the future.

## Experiments

Detailed instructions for reproducing our experiments will be added to the repository.

## Results

Our experimental results will be detailed once the code and data are available.
